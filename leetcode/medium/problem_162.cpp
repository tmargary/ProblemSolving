162. Find Peak Element

A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

    int findPeakElement(vector<int>& nums) {

        int length = nums.size();

        for (int i=1; i < length; ++i){
            if (nums[i] < nums[i-1]){return i-1;}
            else if (i == length-1){return i;}
        }
    return 0;
    }
